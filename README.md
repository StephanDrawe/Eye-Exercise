# Eye-Exercise
## Description:
This is the 'Eyes Exercise' project assignment through MIT coding bootcamp.
This project tracks the movement of the mouse with images of two eyes created using CSS. The purpose of this project is to learn to code DOM manipulation through JavaScript, CSS, and HTML with external inputs, such as the mouse movement.
## How to Run:
1. Fork the repository in its entirety into your account.
2. clone the repository to your machine.
3. Open the 'index.html' file in your browser of choice.
4. Move your mouse around the browser window to see the 'eyes' follow your movement.
## Roadmap of future improvements:
In the next iterations of the program, we will add more styles and import images of people or characters who's eyes follows the mouse movement.
